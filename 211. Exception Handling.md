# **Exception Handling**

#### **What is Exception Handling?**

Exception Handling in Java is a **mechanism to handle runtime errors** (called exceptions) so that the normal flow of the program is not disturbed. It allows the program to continue execution or fail gracefully with proper error messages instead of crashing.

### **What is an Exception?**

An **exception** is an **unexpected event** that occurs during the execution of a program that **disrupts** the normal flow of instructions.


### **Types of Exceptions**

1. **Checked Exceptions**  
   - Known as **compile-time exceptions**  
   - Must be either caught using `try-catch` or declared using `throws`  
   - Example: `IOException`, `SQLException`, `FileNotFoundException`

2. **Unchecked Exceptions**  
   - Known as **runtime exceptions**  
   - Occur during program execution, and not checked at compile time  
   - Example: `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

3. **Errors**  
   - Serious problems that applications should not try to catch  
   - Example: `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`

 # **Java exception handling keywords**

### **1. try**

**What it does:**  
The `try` block is like saying **“Try running this code, but watch out—it might cause a problem.”**

**How it works:**  
You put any **risky code** (like dividing by zero, reading a file, or accessing a null object) inside the `try` block.

**Example:**
```java
try {
    int a = 10 / 0;  // risky code
}
```

**Why it's used:**  
To tell Java: “Keep an eye on this code. If something goes wrong, don’t crash—just catch the problem.”

---

### **2. catch**

**What it does:**  
The `catch` block says **“If something goes wrong in the try block, I’ll handle the problem here.”**

**How it works:**  
It catches the exception (error) that was thrown in the try block and lets you give a proper message or fix it.

**Example:**
```java
try {
    int a = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("You cannot divide by zero.");
}
```

**Why it's used:**  
To give users a proper error message and continue the program without crashing.

### **3. finally**

**What it does:**  
The `finally` block says **“No matter what happens—whether there’s an error or not—this code will always run.”**

**How it works:**  
It’s mostly used for **cleanup** like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting databases.

**Example:**
```java
try {
    int a = 10 / 2;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error occurred");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Always runs this block");
}
```

**Why it's used:**  
To make sure that some important code **always runs**—even if an error happens.

---

### **4. throw**

**What it does:**  
The `throw` keyword says **“I want to manually throw an error now.”**

**How it works:**  
You can use `throw` to raise your own exceptions when you know something is wrong.

**Example:**
```java
int age = 15;
if (age < 18) {
    throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote");
}
```

**Why it's used:**  
To stop the program when a specific situation occurs that you define as wrong.

---

### **5. throws**

**What it does:**  
The `throws` keyword says **“This method might throw an error, so whoever calls it should handle it.”**

**How it works:**  
It’s like a **warning label** on a method telling others, “You must be ready to catch this exception.”

**Example:**
```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileReader f = new FileReader("file.txt");
}
```

**Why it's used:**  
To inform the Java compiler and other programmers that this method may cause an exception, and they must handle it properly.
