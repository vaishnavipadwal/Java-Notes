## **Servlet Lifecycle** 

### 1. **Loading and Instantiation**
When a servlet is requested for the first time or when the server starts, the servlet container loads the servlet class into memory and creates an instance of the servlet. This happens only once during the lifecycle. The servlet is loaded either eagerly when the server starts or lazily when the first request is made to the servlet.

### 2. **Initialization (`init()` method)**
The init() method is called after the servlet is instantiated and before it starts handling requests. It is used to initialize the servlet and set up any resources needed by the servlet, like database connections or configuration parameters. This method is called only once in the lifecycle.

### 3. **Request Handling (`service()` method)**
The service() method is called every time a client sends a request to the servlet. The method processes the request and generates an appropriate response. It internally calls methods like doGet(), doPost(), etc., depending on the type of HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.). This method is called each time a client request is made.

### 4. **Destruction (`destroy()` method)**
The destroy() method is called when the servlet is about to be removed from memory. This happens when the servlet container shuts down or when the servlet is no longer needed. It allows the servlet to release resources such as closing database connections or cleaning up any resources initialized in the init() method. This method is called only once before the servlet is destroyed.


### Why is the Lifecycle Important?

The **lifecycle** of a servlet is important because:
- **Initialization** lets you set up things like database connections only once instead of doing it every time.
- **Service** is the part where the actual work happens, and each request might be handled differently.
- **Destruction** ensures that when the servlet is not needed, everything gets cleaned up to avoid performance issues.
