# **Garbage Collection in Java**

- The **Garbage Collector (GC)** in Java is an automatic memory management feature that helps in reclaiming memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.
- It is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and works in the background to ensure efficient memory usage without the programmer needing to explicitly free memory.

Here are some key points about the Garbage Collector:

1. **Automatic Memory Management**:
   - Java uses an automatic garbage collection process to handle memory allocation and deallocation. This ensures that unused objects are removed, preventing memory leaks.

2. **Heap Memory**:
   - Objects in Java are created in the heap memory. When an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

3. **Reachability**:
   - An object is considered eligible for garbage collection when there are no live references pointing to it, meaning it cannot be accessed or used by the program anymore.

4. **Garbage Collection Process**:
   - The garbage collection process works by identifying unused objects and freeing up memory. It does this by running periodically and identifying unreachable objects.
   - Java provides different types of GC algorithms like **Mark and Sweep**, **Generational Garbage Collection**, and others.

5. **Stop-the-world Event**:
   - Garbage collection is typically a "stop-the-world" event, where all application threads are paused temporarily to allow the garbage collector to reclaim memory.

6. **Manual Control**:
   - Though the garbage collection process is automatic, Java provides hints like `System.gc()` to suggest garbage collection, but the final decision of when to run the garbage collector is up to the JVM.

7. **Performance**:
   - Although the garbage collector runs automatically, it can impact performance since it pauses the application for a brief period during collection. However, modern JVMs use optimized garbage collectors to minimize the pause time.

8. **Types of Garbage Collectors**:
   - **Serial GC**: Uses a single thread for garbage collection.
   - **Parallel GC**: Uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection.
   - **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)**: Focuses on minimizing pause times.
   - **G1 (Garbage First) GC**: A more modern and efficient garbage collector that divides the heap into regions and aims to achieve high throughput with low pause times.


### **Example to Understand Object Time and GC**
```java
class Test {
    public void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Object is destroyed by GC");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t1 = new Test();
        Test t2 = new Test();
        t1 = null;
        t2 = null;
        System.gc(); // Requests GC
    }
}
```
Output (may vary):  
```
Object is destroyed by GC  
Object is destroyed by GC
```
