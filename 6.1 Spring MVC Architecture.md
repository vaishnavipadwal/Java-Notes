# **Spring MVC Architecture** 


**Spring MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a framework used to build web applications in Java by separating the application into three major components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**. It follows the MVC design pattern which helps in building clean, maintainable, and loosely coupled web applications.

The major components involved are:

1. **Model:** 
   - Represents the application's data.
   - It contains the business logic and interacts with the database.
   - Example: A Java class like `Student.java` holding student details like name, id, etc.

2. **View:** 
   - It is used to render the output to the user (UI).
   - Spring MVC supports many types of views like JSP, Thymeleaf, HTML pages, etc.
   - Example: A JSP page displaying student information.

3. **Controller:** 
   - It acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.
   - It receives the request from the user, processes it (using the model), and returns the appropriate view.

### **How Spring MVC Architecture Works:**

1. **Client Request:**
   - The user sends an HTTP request from the browser (like clicking a link or submitting a form).

2. **Front Controller (DispatcherServlet):**
   - In Spring MVC, `DispatcherServlet` acts as the Front Controller.
   - It receives all incoming requests.
   - It checks the request and delegates it to the appropriate controller.

3. **Handler Mapping:**
   - Based on the URL, Spring uses Handler Mapping to find the right controller method to handle the request.

4. **Controller:**
   - The controller processes the request.
   - It interacts with the model (business logic, database).
   - It prepares the data and returns it along with the name of the view to `DispatcherServlet`.

5. **Model and View:**
   - The model contains the data that needs to be displayed.
   - The view name tells which view page (JSP/HTML) to render.

6. **View Resolver:**
   - The View Resolver maps the view name to the actual view file (like a JSP file).
   - It helps in locating the correct view to display.

7. **Display Response:**
   - The selected view (like a JSP page) displays the final output to the user.
