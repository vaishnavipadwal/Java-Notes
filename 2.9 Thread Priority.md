### **Thread Priority**

#### **What is Thread Priority?**

In Java, **thread priority** is a number that indicates the **importance** or **preference** of a thread when the CPU chooses which thread to run. Every thread in Java has a priority, and these priorities are represented by integer values ranging from **1 to 10**.

Java provides **three constants** from the `Thread` class to define priority levels:
- `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` = **1** (Least priority)
- `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` = **5** (Default priority)
- `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` = **10** (Highest priority)

These values help the **thread scheduler** (which is part of the JVM and OS) decide which thread to run when multiple threads are waiting for execution. However, thread priority is only a **hint**, not a command — the actual execution order **depends on the JVM and the OS**.

### **Why Use Thread Priority?**

- **In real-time or time-sensitive tasks**, you might want some threads to have higher priority (like background updates vs. user interaction).
- In **game development**, **animations**, or **media processing**, high-priority threads may ensure smoother performance.

### **Java Program to Demonstrate Thread Priority**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running with priority: " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());
    }
}

public class ThreadPriorityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t3 = new MyThread();

        // Set custom thread names
        t1.setName("LowPriorityThread");
        t2.setName("NormalPriorityThread");
        t3.setName("HighPriorityThread");

        // Set priorities
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  // Priority 1
        t2.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // Priority 5
        t3.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Priority 10

        // Start all threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
```

### **Output**

```
HighPriorityThread is running with priority: 10
LowPriorityThread is running with priority: 1
NormalPriorityThread is running with priority: 5
```

> ⚠️ Note: The output order **may vary** with each execution, because **thread priority is only a suggestion**, and the JVM and OS decide the actual scheduling.

### **Explanation**

- **Thread Priorities are Suggestions**: Just because a thread has higher priority doesn’t mean it will always run before others. It increases the *chance* of running earlier.
- **t1** (LowPriorityThread) has priority 1 — it has the lowest chance of getting CPU time quickly.
- **t2** (NormalPriorityThread) has priority 5 — it's a balanced thread with normal priority.
- **t3** (HighPriorityThread) has priority 10 — it's given preference over others when scheduling decisions are made.
- The scheduler might still allow lower priority threads to execute before or between higher priority ones.
