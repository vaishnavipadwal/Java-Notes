# **Servlet**

## **What is a Servlet?**
A Servlet is a Java program that runs on a server, handles HTTP requests, and sends back responses to the client, usually in the form of HTML or JSON. Servlets are used to build dynamic web applications.
Imagine you're visiting a website. When you enter the website address in your browser, the browser sends a request to the **server** where the website is hosted. A **Servlet** is a small Java program that runs on this server. Its job is to process these requests and send back responses (like displaying a webpage or showing data).

For example, if you're logging in to a website, a servlet might check your username and password, then show you a success message or an error message.

### Why Do We Need Servlets?

- **Dynamic Web Pages**: Unlike regular static web pages (which always look the same), servlets help create **dynamic pages** that can change based on user input or database data.
  
- **Efficient Handling**: When many people visit the website at once, servlets are efficient at managing requests and ensuring everything works smoothly.

- **Server-Side Logic**: Instead of running complex logic in the browser (which can be slow and insecure), servlets handle the heavy lifting on the **server side**. This keeps things more secure and efficient.

### How Does a Servlet Work?

1. **Request Handling**:
   - When a user clicks a link or submits a form on a webpage, the browser sends a **request** to the server.
   - A servlet running on the server handles that request and decides what to do next.

2. **Response**:
   - After processing the request (for example, checking if a user is logged in), the servlet sends a **response** back to the browser. This could be a webpage, a message, or even some data like a list of products.

### A Simple Example of a Servlet

Letâ€™s say you have a servlet that returns a simple message when someone visits the website:

```java
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    
    @Override
    public void init() throws ServletException {
        // This happens only once when the servlet is first created.
        System.out.println("Servlet is being initialized...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
        // This is where we handle the request. For now, just send a message.
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("<html><body><h1>Hello, this is a servlet!</h1></body></html>");
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        // This happens when the servlet is about to be destroyed.
        System.out.println("Servlet is being destroyed...");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The **init()** method is called once when the servlet is created (like opening the restaurant).
- The **doGet()** method handles each request (like cooking a dish for each customer).
- The **destroy()** method is called when the servlet is no longer needed (like closing the restaurant).
