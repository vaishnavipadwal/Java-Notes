# **Servlet**

## What is a Servlet?

Imagine you're visiting a website. When you enter the website address in your browser, the browser sends a request to the **server** where the website is hosted. A **Servlet** is a small Java program that runs on this server. Its job is to process these requests and send back responses (like displaying a webpage or showing data).

For example, if you're logging in to a website, a servlet might check your username and password, then show you a success message or an error message.

### Why Do We Need Servlets?

- **Dynamic Web Pages**: Unlike regular static web pages (which always look the same), servlets help create **dynamic pages** that can change based on user input or database data.
  
- **Efficient Handling**: When many people visit the website at once, servlets are efficient at managing requests and ensuring everything works smoothly.

- **Server-Side Logic**: Instead of running complex logic in the browser (which can be slow and insecure), servlets handle the heavy lifting on the **server side**. This keeps things more secure and efficient.

### How Does a Servlet Work?

1. **Request Handling**:
   - When a user clicks a link or submits a form on a webpage, the browser sends a **request** to the server.
   - A servlet running on the server handles that request and decides what to do next.

2. **Response**:
   - After processing the request (for example, checking if a user is logged in), the servlet sends a **response** back to the browser. This could be a webpage, a message, or even some data like a list of products.
