# **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**

**JSP (JavaServer Pages)** is a server-side technology in Java used to create dynamic web pages. It allows embedding Java code directly into HTML pages using special JSP tags, making it easier to develop web applications that interact with backend logic.

**Explanation:**

1. JSP stands for *JavaServer Pages*.

2. It is used to create dynamic, platform-independent web content, usually for generating HTML, XML, or other types of documents in response to user requests.

3. When a JSP page is requested, the server translates it into a servlet (Java class), compiles it, and executes the servlet to generate the final response.

4. JSP supports special tags like `<% %>` for Java code, `<%= %>` to output expressions, and custom tag libraries for cleaner structure.

5. JSP works seamlessly with JavaBeans, JDBC, and other Java technologies, enabling interaction with databases, session management, and more.

6. Simplifies web development by allowing HTML and Java code to coexist, promotes separation of business logic from presentation, and is easier to maintain than pure servlets.
