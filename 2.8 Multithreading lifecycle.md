## **Multithreading and its lifecycle**
Multithreading is a concurrent execution technique in Java, where multiple threads run independently but share the same resources. A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process. Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and resource utilization.
**Thread Lifecycle**
The lifecycle of a thread in Java refers to the various states a thread goes through from its creation until it terminates. These states are managed by the Java Thread Scheduler. The main states are:

1. **New (Born) State**:
   - A thread is in the *new* state when it is created but has not yet started running.
   - Example: `Thread t = new Thread();`

2. **Runnable State**:
   - A thread enters the *runnable* state when the `start()` method is called on the thread object. In this state, the thread is ready to run but may not necessarily be running. The thread scheduler determines which thread runs when.
   - Example: `t.start();`

3. **Blocked (Waiting) State**:ultithreading and its lifecycle
   - A thread enters the *blocked* state when it wants to access a resource that another thread is currently using (e.g., when it is waiting to acquire a lock in synchronized blocks). It stays in this state until the resource becomes available.

4. **Waiting State**:
   - A thread can enter the *waiting* state when it is waiting for another thread to perform some action (e.g., waiting for a notification). It enters this state using methods like `wait()`, `join()`, or `sleep()`.
   - Example: `t.join();`

5. **Timed Waiting State**:
   - A thread enters the *timed waiting* state when it is sleeping for a specific period, or it is waiting for a specific amount of time to pass before it can resume its task. The methods used to put a thread in this state include `sleep(milliseconds)` and `join(milliseconds)`.

6. **Terminated (Dead) State**:
   - A thread enters the *terminated* state when its `run()` method has completed, or it has been terminated due to some error or exception.
   - Example: The thread completes its task or an exception causes it to stop.


### **Java Program for Multithreading**

```java
// Class extending Thread to create a custom thread
class MyThread extends Thread {
    private String threadName;

    // Constructor to set the name of the thread
    MyThread(String name) {
        threadName = name;
    }

    // Overriding run() method to define the task
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(threadName + " is printing: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work with a 1 second delay
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class MultithreadingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating two thread objects
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread("Thread 1");
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread("Thread 2");

        // Starting the threads
        thread1.start();  // This invokes the run() method of thread1
        thread2.start();  // This invokes the run() method of thread2
    }
}
```
### **Output**

```
Thread 1 is printing: 1
Thread 2 is printing: 1
Thread 1 is printing: 2
Thread 2 is printing: 2
Thread 1 is printing: 3
Thread 2 is printing: 3
Thread 1 is printing: 4
Thread 2 is printing: 4
Thread 1 is printing: 5
Thread 2 is printing: 5
```
