# **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** flow in a **Spring MVC** application:

**Model**  
The **Model** represents the **data** and **business logic** of the application. It holds the information that the application needs to display or process. In Spring MVC, model classes are normal Java classes (POJOs) that contain fields, getters, and setters. When a user submits a form, the data is populated into a model object, and when the controller sends data to the view, it is sent through the model.

**Example**:  
`Student.java` with fields like `name`, `rollNo`, `branch`, etc., is a **Model**.

---

**View**  
The **View** is the **presentation layer** of the application. It defines **what the user sees**. In Spring MVC, views are usually JSP files, Thymeleaf templates, or any other UI page. The view uses the data from the Model and renders it in a way that users can see and interact with.

**Example**:  
`registration.jsp` for filling the form and `success.jsp` for displaying submitted data are **Views**.

---

**Controller**  
The **Controller** is the **brain** of the application that handles the **user input**, **processes it**, and **decides which view** to show as the response. In Spring MVC, a controller is a Java class annotated with `@Controller`. It handles HTTP requests (GET, POST), collects input data (like from forms), interacts with the model, and returns a view name for rendering.

**Example**:  
`StudentController.java` handles the incoming requests, binds form data to the `Student` model, and sends it to the success view.
